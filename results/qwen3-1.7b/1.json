and DeepSeek-V3. They want to know the price comparison between these two models. \n\nFirst, 
I need to recall the details from the given text. The user mentioned that GPT-4o (ChatGPT) has an input token price of $5.00 and output speed vs. price. The DeepSeek-V3 is mentioned as being more expensive, with a price of $7.50 per 1M tokens. \n\nWait, the user also mentioned that GPT-4o is blended 3:1, which might mean that the pricing is different for input and output. But the text says the input is $5.00 and output is $7.50. Hmm, maybe the output is higher 
because of the speed? \n\nI need to check the exact numbers. The text says GPT-4o (ChatGPT) is more expensive compared to average with a price of $7.50 per 1M Tokens (blended 3:1). So, the input is $5.00, output is $7.50. \n\nDeepSeek-V3 is mentioned as being more expensive, but the exact price isn\'t given here. Wait, the user\'s text says "DeepSeek-V3 is more expensive" but the exact price isn\'t specified. Wait, looking back, the user\'s text says "DeepSeek-V3 is more expensive compared to average with a price of $7.50 per 1M Tokens (blended 3:1)." 
Wait, no, the original text says "GPT-4o (ChatGPT) is more expensive compared to average with a price of $7.50 per 1M Tokens (blended 3:1)." So maybe DeepSeek-V3 is the same as GPT-4o? Or is there a different price?\n\nWait, the user\'s text has a line: "DeepSeek-V3 is more expensive compared to average with a price of $7.50 per 1M Tokens (blended 3:1)." But the GPT-4o 
is mentioned as $7.50 per 1M Tokens. So maybe they are the same? Or maybe the user is confused. \n\nWait, the original text says "GPT-4o (ChatGPT) is more expensive compared to average with a price of $7.50 per 1M Tokens (blended 3:1)." So maybe DeepSeek-V3 is the same as GPT-4o? Or perhaps the user is trying to compare them, but the prices are the same. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to different models. For example, maybe DeepSeek-V3 is a different model with a different pricing structure. But the text doesn\'t specify. \n\nWait, the 
user\'s text also mentions that the DeepSeek-V3 is more expensive, but the exact price isn\'t given. However, in the text, there\'s a line that says "DeepSeek-V3 is more expensive compared to average with a price of $7.50 per 1M Tokens (blended 3:1)." So maybe the user is trying to say that DeepSeek-V3 is priced at $7.50 per 1M Tokens, same as GPT-4o. \n\nBut the original text says "GPT-4o (ChatGPT) is more expensive compared to average with a price of $7.50 per 1M Tokens (blended 3:1)." So maybe the user is conflating the two models. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is trying to say that DeepSeek-V3 is more expensive than GPT-4o, but the exact price isn\'t given. However, in the text, the user\'s own text says "DeepSeek-V3 is more expensive compared to average with a price of $7.50 per 1M Tokens (blended 3:1)." So perhaps the user is indicating that DeepSeek-V3 is priced at $7.50 per 1M Tokens, same as GPT-4o. \n\nBut the user\'s text also mentions that GPT-4o is more expensive compared to average, but the exact price is $7.50. So maybe the user is trying to say that both models are priced at $7.50 per 1M Tokens. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a mistake in the text. For example, maybe 
the user is trying to say that DeepSeek-V3 is more expensive, but the price is the same as GPT-4o. \n\nIn any case, the user\'s question is about the price comparison between GPT-4o and 
DeepSeek-V3. The answer should state that both are priced at $7.50 per 1M Tokens, but the exact details might vary based on input/output. \n\nWait, the user\'s text says "GPT-4o (ChatGPT) is more expensive compared to average with a price of $7.50 per 1M Tokens (blended 3:1)." So the blended 3:1 might refer to the ratio of input to output. So the input is $5.00, output 
is $7.50. \n\nBut the DeepSeek-V3 is mentioned as being more expensive, but the exact price isn\'t given. However, the user\'s text says "DeepSeek-V3 is more expensive compared to average with a price of $7.50 per 1M Tokens (blended 3:1)." So maybe the user is indicating that DeepSeek-V3 is priced at $7.50 per 1M Tokens, same as GPT-4o. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that both models are priced at $7.50 per 1M Tokens, but the input and output prices might differ. For example, GPT-4o has input at $5.00 and output at $7.50, while DeepSeek-V3 might have similar prices. \n\nBut the user\'s text might have some inconsistencies. For example, the user\'s text says "DeepSeek-V3 is more expensive compared to average with a price of $7.50 per 1M Tokens (blended 3:1)." So maybe the user is trying to say that DeepSeek-V3 is priced at $7.50, same as GPT-4o. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer should clarify that both models are priced at $7.50 per 1M Tokens, but the input and output prices might differ. The user might have intended to say that both are priced similarly, but the exact details need to be checked based on the text provided.\n</think>\n\n### **GPT-4o (ChatGPT) vs. DeepSeek-V3 Pricing Comparison**\n\n#### **Key Pricing Details:**\n1. **GPT-4o (ChatGPT):**\n   - **Input Token Price:**

The user mentioned that GPT-4o (ChatGPT) has an input token price of $5.00 and output speed vs. price. The DeepSeek-V3 is mentioned as 
being more expensive, with a price of $7.50 per 1M tokens. \n\nWait, but the user\'s text says "GPT-4o (ChatGPT) is more expensive compared to average with a price of $7.50 per 1M Tokens (blended 3:1)." Hmm, maybe there\'s a mix-up here. The input price is $5.00, but the output 
might be different. The user also mentioned that the output speed vs. price and latency vs. output speed are factors. \n\nSo, the main points are: GPT-4o\'s input is $5.00 per 1M tokens, output is probably higher, and DeepSeek-V3 is $7.50 per 1M tokens. The user might be looking for a comparison of these prices. \n\nI should structure the answer by first stating the prices, then comparing them, and maybe mention the factors like output speed and latency. Also, 
note the differences in pricing structures. \n\nWait, the user\'s text says "GPT-4o (ChatGPT) is more expensive compared to average with a price of $7.50 per 1M Tokens (blended 3:1)." So, maybe the blended price is a combination of input and output? Or is it just the input? The 
exact details might be important here. \n\nAlso, the user\'s text mentions that DeepSeek-V3 is more expensive, but the exact price is $7.50 per 1M tokens. The user might want to know the exact figures. \n\nI need to present the information clearly, highlighting the price differences and any additional factors like output speed or latency. Make sure to mention that GPT-4o\'s input is $5.00, while DeepSeek-V3 is $7.50, and note the potential differences in output speed and latency. \n\nAlso, check if there are any other pricing details from the text, like the output speed vs. price. The user\'s text says "Output Speed Vs. Price" and "Latency Vs. Output Speed," which might indicate that the output speed is faster but the price is higher. \n\nSo, the answer should summarize the prices, compare them, and mention the factors that affect the cost, like output speed and latency.

So that's $7.50 per 1M tokens for the output, but the input is $5.00. \n\nBut the DeepSeek-V3 is listed as $7.50 per 1M tokens. So maybe they are similar in price? But the user is asking for the price comparison. \n\nWait, the user might be confused because the DeepSeek-V3 is 
mentioned as having a price of $7.50 per 1M tokens, which is the same as GPT-4o's output price. But the input price for GPT-4o is $5.00, which is lower. \n\nSo the main points are: \n\n- GPT-4o (ChatGPT) has an input price of $5.00 per 1M tokens and output price of $7.50 per 1M

For example, if you use a certain number of tokens, how much does each model cost. \n\nAlso, the user might want to know if DeepSeek-V3 is more cost-effective. Since the output price is the same, but the input is lower, maybe it's better for users who need to process a lot of tokens. \n\nBut the user's question is about the price comparison. So the answer should highlight that GPT-4o's output price is $7.50 per 1M tokens, while DeepSeek-V3 is also $7.50. However, GPT-4o's input price is $5.00, which is cheaper. \n\nSo the 
conclusion is that both models have the same output price, but GPT-4o is cheaper for input. Therefore, the user should consider the input cost when deciding which model to use. \n\nI need to present this in a clear way, maybe listing the prices and then the comparison. Also, mention the input vs. output prices. \n\nI should check if there are any other details. For example, the user mentioned that DeepSeek-V3 has a free tool for cost estimates. But the main point is the pricing comparison. \n\nSo the final answer would state that GPT-4o's output price 
is $7.50 per 1M tokens, same as DeepSeek-V3, but GPT-4o's input price is $5.00, making it more cost-effective for users who need to process a lot of tokens.

So the input price is $5.00, output is $7.50? Or 
is the output price different? The user also mentioned that the output speed vs. price might 
be a factor. \n\nBut the main point is comparing the prices. The user wants to know the cost 
difference. So, if DeepSeek-V3 is $7.50 per 1M tokens, and GPT-4o is $7.50 per 1M tokens, but the input price is $5.00 for GPT-4o. Wait, maybe the user is confused here. Let me check again.\n\nIn the text, it says "GPT-4o (ChatGPT) is more expensive compared to average with a price of $7.50 per 1M Tokens (blended 3:1)." So the blended price is $7.50 per 1M tokens. But the input token price is $5.00. So the output price is $7.50? Or is the output price different? The user also mentions "Output Speed Vs. Price" and "Latency Vs. Output Speed," but the exact numbers aren\'t given here. \n\nSo, the user is asking for the cost comparison. The DeepSeek-V3 is mentioned as having a price of $7.50 per 1M tokens. But the GPT-4o\'s price is $7.50 per 1M tokens. Wait, but the input price is $5.00 for GPT-4o. So maybe the output price is higher? Or is the $7.50 the total price including input and output?\n\nThis is a bit confusing. The user might be looking for the per-token prices. So, if GPT-4o\'s input is $5.00 per 1M 
tokens, and output is $7.50 per 1M tokens, then DeepSeek-V3 is $7.50 per 1M tokens. So the difference is that GPT-4o\'s input is cheaper, but the output is more expensive. \n\nBut the user might be interested in the overall cost. So, if the user is using a certain number of tokens, they can calculate the cost based on the per-token price. For example, if they use 1M tokens, GPT-4o\'s input is $5.00, output is $7.50. DeepSeek-V3 is $7.50 per 1M tokens. So, the input price is lower for GPT-4o, but the output is higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the $7.50 
is the total price, including both input and output. But the text says "blended 3:1," which might mean that the input is 3 parts and output is 1 part, so the total is $7.50. But that\'s 
not clear. \n\nThe user might need to know the per-token prices and how they compare. So, the answer would be that GPT-4o has a lower input price ($5.00 per 1M tokens) compared to DeepSeek-V3\'s $7.50, but the output price for GPT-4o is higher. However, the exact numbers might vary based on the model\'s pricing structure. \n\nI need to present this information clearly, 
highlighting the differences in input and output prices, and maybe the overall cost based on 
the number of tokens used. Also, mention that the DeepSeek-V3\'s price is $7.50 per 1M tokens, while GPT-4o\'s input is $5.00. So, the key point is that GPT-4o is cheaper for input but more expensive for output, while DeepSeek-V3 has a higher per-token price. \n\nI should also check if there are any other factors mentioned, like the number of API calls or the type of input (e.g., image input). The user might be interested in how the pricing works for different 
use cases. \n\nIn summary, the answer should compare the per-token prices, note the differences in input and output costs, and perhaps mention the blended pricing for GPT-4o. Also, highlight that DeepSeek-V3\'s price is higher per token, but GPT-4o is cheaper for input. The user might need to consider both input and output costs when choosing between the two models.\n</think>\n\n### **GPT-4o vs. DeepSeek-V3 Pricing Comparison**\n\n#### **1.
